## Front Matter
Welcome to my little corner of the tubes, where I occasionally post about maps, statistics, cooking, baking, and other interests. Make yourself at home, grab a beer, and find some posts that interest you... or, don't - I'm here for me, not to tell *you* what to do.

## Odds and Ends
#### SDF
This site is meant to replace my old [SDF](http://the.fedora.sdf.org), which I maintained in bare HTML. That became onerous, and does not support modern web features like SSL without extra work I don't have time to fiddle with. So, here we are.

#### GPG
This is my [GPG](./signature.html) public key.

#### Jekyll
This site is made with [Jekyll](./about).
